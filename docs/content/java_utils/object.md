### registerNatives

native方法是联系Java程序和底层主机操作系统的连接方法,一个Java程序要想调用一个本地方法，需要执行两个步骤：

1. 通过System.loadLibrary()将包含本地方法实现的动态文件加载进内存；
2. 当Java程序需要调用本地方法时，虚拟机在加载的动态文件中定位并链接该本地方法，从而得以执行本地方法。

registerNatives()方法的作用就是取代第2步，让程序主动将本地方法链接到调用方，当Java程序需要调用本地方法时就可以直接调用，而不需要虚拟机再去定位并链接

registerNatives本质上就是一个本地方法，但这又是一个有别于一般本地方法的本地方法，该方法应该是用来注册本地方法的:注册的方法就是该类所包含的除了registerNatives()方法以外的所有本地方法

### clone方法

* clone()方法 与new constructor()构造器创建对象不同 是克隆一个新的对象
* clone()方法 对象里面的成员一般是`浅拷贝`

使用clone的步骤
1. 实现clone的类首先需要继承Cloneable接口。Cloneable接口实质上是一个标识接口，没有任何接口方法。
2. 在类中重写Object类中的clone()方法。
3. 在clone方法中调用super.clone()。无论clone类的继承结构是什么，super.clone()都会直接或间接调用java.lang,Object类的clone()方法。
4. 把浅复制的引用指向原型对象新的克隆体。

```java
class Car {
    public String name;
}
class Man implements Cloneable{
    public Integer id;
    public String name;
    public Car car;

    public Man() {
    }

    public Man(Integer id, String name) {
        this.id = id;
        this.name = name;
        Car car = new Car();
        car.name = id+":"+name;
        this.car = car;
    }

    public void setName(String name) {
        this.name = name;
    }

    public Integer getId() {
        return id;
    }

    public void setId(Integer id) {
        this.id = id;
    }

    public String getName() {
        return name;
    }

    public Car getCar() {
        return car;
    }

    public void setCar(Car car) {
        this.car = car;
    }

//    @Override
//    protected Object clone() throws CloneNotSupportedException {
//        return super.clone();
//    }

    @Override
    public Object clone(){
        Man m = new Man();
        m.setId(this.getId());
        m.setName(this.getName());
        Car car = null;
        if(this.car != null) {
            car = new Car();
            car.name = this.car.name;
        }
        m.setCar(car);
        return m;
    }
}

public class Main {

    public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception{
        Man m1 = new Man(1, "A");
        Man m2 = m1;
        System.out.println(m1);
        System.out.println(m2);

        m2.getCar().name = "m2";

        System.out.println(m1.getCar().name);
        System.out.println(m2.getCar().name);

        Man m3 = (Man) m1.clone();
        System.out.println(m1);
        System.out.println(m3);
        System.out.println(m1 == m3);
        System.out.println(m1.getCar());
        System.out.println(m3.getCar());

        m3.getCar().name = "m3";

        System.out.println(m1.getCar().name);
        System.out.println(m3.getCar().name);
    }
}
```

### finalize()

在GC准备释放对象所占用的内存空间之前，它将首先调用finalize()方法;

**第一次GC遍历处理**：通过`GC roots`遍历，找到不在引用链内的对象。并检查是否需要执行`finalize()`方法。（如果没重写finalize()则只需要标记一次，然后就可以进行gc掉）

在第一次标记中有`finalize()`需要被执行的对象，会被丢到一个优先级较低的队列(`F-Queue`:`java.lang.ref.Finalizer.ReferenceQueue`)中执行，但不保证能被执行(因为是由**低优先级**的`Finalizer线程`去处理的，试想低优先级线程不被执行到，那么重写了`finalize()`的对象就永久在堆中不能被gc掉，即`java.lang.ref.Finalizer`对象会占用很大的堆空间，甚至溢出)

**第二次**：对队列(`F-Queue`)中的对象再遍历一次，看是否有自救，没有则进行GC

### getClass方法

在Java中一切都是对象，我们一般所使用的对象都直接或间接继承自Object类。Object类中包含一个方法名叫getClass，利用这个方法就可以获得一个实例的class对象。这个对象指的是代表一个类型的对象，因为一切皆是对象，类型也不例外，在Java使用class类的对象来表示一个类型。所有的类型类都是Class类的实例。

附，获取Class对象的几种方法：

1. Class.forName("类的全限定名")
2. 实例对象.getClass()
3. 类名.class（类字面常量）

## 附：Object类的源码

```java

 * Every class has {@code Object} as a superclass. All objects,
 * including arrays, implement the methods of this class.

 * @see     java.lang.Class
 * @since   JDK1.0
 */
public class Object {

    private static native void registerNatives();
    static {
        registerNatives();
    }

    /**
     * Returns the runtime class of this {@code Object}. The returned
     * {@code Class} object is the object that is locked by {@code
     * static synchronized} methods of the represented class.
     *
     * <p><b>The actual result type is {@code Class<? extends |X|>}
     * where {@code |X|} is the erasure of the static type of the

     *
     * <p>
     * {@code Number n = 0;                             }<br>

     *         class of this object.
     * @jls 15.8.2 Class Literals
     */
    public final native Class<?> getClass();

    /**
     * Returns a hash code value for the object. This method is
     * supported for the benefit of hash tables such as those provided by
     * {@link java.util.HashMap}.
     * <p>
     * The general contract of {@code hashCode} is:
     * <ul>
     * <li>Whenever it is invoked on the same object more than once during
     *     an execution of a Java application, the {@code hashCode} method
     *     must consistently return the same integer, provided no information
     *     used in {@code equals} comparisons on the object is modified.
     *     This integer need not remain consistent from one execution of an
     *     application to another execution of the same application.
     * <li>If two objects are equal according to the {@code equals(Object)}
     *     method, then calling the {@code hashCode} method on each of
     *     the two objects must produce the same integer result.
     * <li>It is <em>not</em> required that if two objects are unequal
     *     according to the {@link java.lang.Object#equals(java.lang.Object)}
     *     method, then calling the {@code hashCode} method on each of the
     *     two objects must produce distinct integer results.  However, the
     *     programmer should be aware that producing distinct integer results
     *     for unequal objects may improve the performance of hash tables.
     * </ul>
     * <p>
     * As much as is reasonably practical, the hashCode method defined by
     * class {@code Object} does return distinct integers for distinct
     * objects. (This is typically implemented by converting the internal
     * address of the object into an integer, but this implementation
     * technique is not required by the
     * Java&trade; programming language.)
     *
     * @return  a hash code value for this object.
     * @see     java.lang.Object#equals(java.lang.Object)
     * @see     java.lang.System#identityHashCode
     */
    public native int hashCode();

    /**
     * Indicates whether some other object is "equal to" this one.
     * <p>
     * The {@code equals} method implements an equivalence relation
     * on non-null object references:
     * <ul>
     * <li>It is <i>reflexive</i>: for any non-null reference value
     *     {@code x}, {@code x.equals(x)} should return
     *     {@code true}.
     * <li>It is <i>symmetric</i>: for any non-null reference values
     *     {@code x} and {@code y}, {@code x.equals(y)}
     *     should return {@code true} if and only if
     *     {@code y.equals(x)} returns {@code true}.
     * <li>It is <i>transitive</i>: for any non-null reference values
     *     {@code x}, {@code y}, and {@code z}, if
     *     {@code x.equals(y)} returns {@code true} and
     *     {@code y.equals(z)} returns {@code true}, then
     *     {@code x.equals(z)} should return {@code true}.
     * <li>It is <i>consistent</i>: for any non-null reference values
     *     {@code x} and {@code y}, multiple invocations of
     *     {@code x.equals(y)} consistently return {@code true}
     *     or consistently return {@code false}, provided no
     *     information used in {@code equals} comparisons on the
     *     objects is modified.
     * <li>For any non-null reference value {@code x},
     *     {@code x.equals(null)} should return {@code false}.
     * </ul>
     * <p>
     * The {@code equals} method for class {@code Object} implements
     * the most discriminating possible equivalence relation on objects;
     * that is, for any non-null reference values {@code x} and
     * {@code y}, this method returns {@code true} if and only
     * if {@code x} and {@code y} refer to the same object
     * ({@code x == y} has the value {@code true}).
     * <p>
     * Note that it is generally necessary to override the {@code hashCode}
     * method whenever this method is overridden, so as to maintain the
     * general contract for the {@code hashCode} method, which states
     * that equal objects must have equal hash codes.
     *
     * @param   obj   the reference object with which to compare.
     * @return  {@code true} if this object is the same as the obj
     *          argument; {@code false} otherwise.
     * @see     #hashCode()
     * @see     java.util.HashMap
     */
    public boolean equals(Object obj) {
        return (this == obj);
    }

    /**
     * Creates and returns a copy of this object.  The precise meaning
     * of "copy" may depend on the class of the object. The general
     * intent is that, for any object {@code x}, the expression:
     * <blockquote>
     * <pre>
     * x.clone() != x</pre></blockquote>
     * will be true, and that the expression:
     * <blockquote>
     * <pre>
     * x.clone().getClass() == x.getClass()</pre></blockquote>
     * will be {@code true}, but these are not absolute requirements.
     * While it is typically the case that:
     * <blockquote>
     * <pre>
     * x.clone().equals(x)</pre></blockquote>
     * will be {@code true}, this is not an absolute requirement.
     * <p>
     * By convention, the returned object should be obtained by calling
     * {@code super.clone}.  If a class and all of its superclasses (except
     * {@code Object}) obey this convention, it will be the case that
     * {@code x.clone().getClass() == x.getClass()}.
     * <p>
     * By convention, the object returned by this method should be independent
     * of this object (which is being cloned).  To achieve this independence,
     * it may be necessary to modify one or more fields of the object returned
     * by {@code super.clone} before returning it.  Typically, this means
     * copying any mutable objects that comprise the internal "deep structure"
     * of the object being cloned and replacing the references to these
     * objects with references to the copies.  If a class contains only
     * primitive fields or references to immutable objects, then it is usually
     * the case that no fields in the object returned by {@code super.clone}
     * need to be modified.
     * <p>
     * The method {@code clone} for class {@code Object} performs a
     * specific cloning operation. First, if the class of this object does
     * not implement the interface {@code Cloneable}, then a
     * {@code CloneNotSupportedException} is thrown. Note that all arrays
     * are considered to implement the interface {@code Cloneable} and that
     * the return type of the {@code clone} method of an array type {@code T[]}
     * is {@code T[]} where T is any reference or primitive type.
     * Otherwise, this method creates a new instance of the class of this
     * object and initializes all its fields with exactly the contents of
     * the corresponding fields of this object, as if by assignment; the
     * contents of the fields are not themselves cloned. Thus, this method
     * performs a "shallow copy" of this object, not a "deep copy" operation.
     * <p>
     * The class {@code Object} does not itself implement the interface
     * {@code Cloneable}, so calling the {@code clone} method on an object
     * whose class is {@code Object} will result in throwing an
     * exception at run time.

     *               throw this exception to indicate that an instance cannot

     * amount of real time has elapsed.
     * <p>
     * This method is similar to the {@code wait} method of one
     * argument, but it allows finer control over the amount of time to
     * wait for a notification before giving up. The amount of real time,
     * measured in nanoseconds, is given by:
     * <blockquote>
     * <pre>
     * 1000000*timeout+nanos</pre></blockquote>
     * <p>
     * In all other respects, this method does the same thing as the
     * method {@link #wait(long)} of one argument. In particular,
     * {@code wait(0, 0)} means the same thing as {@code wait(0)}.

     *     to wake up either through a call to the {@code notify} method
     *     or the {@code notifyAll} method.
     * <li>The timeout period, specified by {@code timeout}
     *     milliseconds plus {@code nanos} nanoseconds arguments, has
     *     elapsed.
     * </ul>
     * <p>
     * The thread then waits until it can re-obtain ownership of the
     * monitor and resumes execution.
     * <p>
     * As in the one argument version, interrupts and spurious wakeups are
     * possible, and this method should always be used in a loop:
     * <pre>
     *     synchronized (obj) {

     *         ... // Perform action appropriate to condition
     *     }
     * </pre>
     * This method should only be called by a thread that is the owner
     * of this object's monitor. See the {@code notify} method for a
     * description of the ways in which a thread can become the owner of
     * a monitor.

     * @param      nanos      additional time, in nanoseconds range

     * @throws  IllegalArgumentException      if the value of timeout is
     *                      negative or the value of nanos is
     *                      not in the range 0-999999.
     * @throws  IllegalMonitorStateException  if the current thread is not
     *               the owner of this object's monitor.
     * @throws  InterruptedException if any thread interrupted the
     *             current thread before or while the current thread
     *             was waiting for a notification.  The <i>interrupted

     * determines that there are no more references to the object.
     * A subclass overrides the {@code finalize} method to dispose of
     * system resources or to perform other cleanup.
     * <p>
     * The general contract of {@code finalize} is that it is invoked
     * if and when the Java&trade; virtual
     * machine has determined that there is no longer any
     * means by which this object can be accessed by any thread that has
     * not yet died, except as a result of an action taken by the
     * finalization of some other object or class which is ready to be
     * finalized. The {@code finalize} method may take any action, including
     * making this object available again to other threads; the usual purpose
     * of {@code finalize}, however, is to perform cleanup actions before
     * the object is irrevocably discarded. For example, the finalize method
     * for an object that represents an input/output connection might perform
     * explicit I/O transactions to break the connection before the object is
     * permanently discarded.
     * <p>
     * The {@code finalize} method of class {@code Object} performs no
     * special action; it simply returns normally. Subclasses of
     * {@code Object} may override this definition.
     * <p>
     * The Java programming language does not guarantee which thread will
     * invoke the {@code finalize} method for any given object. It is
     * guaranteed, however, that the thread that invokes finalize will not
     * be holding any user-visible synchronization locks when finalize is
     * invoked. If an uncaught exception is thrown by the finalize method,
     * the exception is ignored and finalization of that object terminates.
     * <p>
     * After the {@code finalize} method has been invoked for an object, no
     * further action is taken until the Java virtual machine has again
     * determined that there is no longer any means by which this object can
     * be accessed by any thread that has not yet died, including possible
     * actions by other objects or classes which are ready to be finalized,
     * at which point the object may be discarded.
     * <p>
     * The {@code finalize} method is never invoked more than once by a Java
     * virtual machine for any given object.
     * <p>
     * Any exception thrown by the {@code finalize} method causes
     * the finalization of this object to be halted, but is otherwise
     * ignored.
